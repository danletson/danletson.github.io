# Fluxx Design Challenge: Redesign of LinkedIn Homepage

by Daniel Letson, June 8 2019.

## Background

In early May of 2019, LinkedIn completely overhauled its main marketing website, moving from a more formally "corporate" look and feel (lean, dark, no-nonsense) in a more friendly, welcoming direction. The new site's aesthetic borrows from the successes of other young SaaS brands like Mailchimp and Slack, incorporating colorful illustration and a more inclusive editorial voice. The company's portfolio has expanded quite a bit in the past few years, and many of the site's underlying pages have not changed, leading to a somewhat disjointed user experience that is often vague in guiding the user to appropriate conversion opportunity.  

## Approach

I chose to tackle the design challenge with pragmatism. Many designers dream of crafting brand-new systems from whole cloth, but in my opinion, the key to developing a rewarding user experience is a commitment to constant testing and improvement. I spent the allotted time not sketching something totally new, but critiquing the existing site and brainstorming improvements to nudge the user experience in line with the prompt ("better promote a single flow that helps potential users see the value of creating a LinkedIn profile and encourages them to do so.")

As someone with experience in marketing, I did my best to think of how to remove friction from the new user flow, and present site visitors with scannable content that speaks to their needs. As a web developer, I decided to flex my coding chops to present my work as two interactive websites, with user experiences of their own.

## Deliverables

An annotated version of the original LinkedIn.com design can be found [here](https://danletson.github.io/linkedin-redesign/original).

A redesigned version can be found [here](https://danletson.github.io/linkedin-redesign/redesign/).

Both sites are marked with red dots ðŸ”´, which, when hovered over, provide annotations explaining my thought process. Please view both sites on a desktop, in Chrome.  

## Further Considerations

The vast majority of the changes proposed are simple enough to enable extensive A/B and multivariate testing. With more time and resources, I would love to have been able to build out mobile styling, spend more time with type hierarchies, explore animation, and derive a stand-alone style guide to more rigorously vet the changes outside of the homepage's specific context.
